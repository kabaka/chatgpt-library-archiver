# ChatGPT Library Archiver

This is a Python-based toolset for downloading, archiving, and browsing images from the ChatGPT image library. It stores all images in a single folder and generates static HTML galleries for easy viewing.

See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for important legal notices.

## ⚠️ Note

Support for legacy versioned gallery folders (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) has been removed.
If you're upgrading from an older release that used those directories, re-download
your images with this version or run a previous release to migrate your data.

## 📦 Folder Structure

```
gallery/
├── images/
├── thumbs/
├── metadata.json
└── index.html  ← single-page gallery
auth.txt        ← credentials for API access
tagging_config.json ← OpenAI API key, model, and prompt for tagging
```

## ⚙️ 1. Setup Instructions

### 🔹 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection
- Your browser access to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)

### 🔹 Install Dependencies

Recommended: use a virtual environment.

Option A — one command bootstrap (creates `.venv`, installs deps, runs):

```
python -m chatgpt_library_archiver bootstrap
```

Option B — manual setup:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## 🛠 2. `auth.txt` — Setup Your Authentication

This file is required for authenticated API access. You can either let the tool prompt you interactively on first run, or create it manually. Here's what it must contain if creating manually:

```
url=https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/my/recent/image_gen?limit=100
authorization=Bearer <your_token_here>
cookie=__Secure-next-auth.session-token=<your_cookie_here>
referer=https://chat.openai.com/library
user_agent=Mozilla/5.0 (...)
oai_client_version=...
oai_device_id=...
oai_language=...
```

### How to Get These:
1. Log into [https://chat.openai.com/library](https://chat.openai.com/library)
2. Open Developer Tools (in Chrome, by pressing F12) → Network tab → Fetch/XHR
3. Scroll down the page to load new images in the library
4. Find any request to `image_gen` : they should look like `image_gen?limit=6&after...`. Click on one of them
5. Scroll down the **Headers** section until you find the required Headers, as in the `auth.txt`
6. Copy the headers exactly as they are; note that for the cookie key, you only need the part starting with `__Secure-next-auth.session-token=...`
7. Paste values into `auth.txt`

The interactive setup saves `auth.txt` with permissions `600` (owner read/write only) to protect your credentials. Never commit this file and store it securely.

## 🧩 `tagging_config.json` — OpenAI Tagging Setup

This file supplies the OpenAI API key and options used when generating tags for
images. It is created automatically on first run of the tagging command, or you
can create it manually with contents like:

```
{
  "api_key": "sk-...",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
  "prompt": "Generate concise, comma-separated tags describing this image.",
  "rename_prompt": "Create a short, descriptive filename slug (kebab-case) for this image."
}
```

Only `api_key` is required; `model` and `prompt` have sensible defaults. Keep
this file private—never commit it to version control.

---

## 🚀 3. Script Usage
### 🧭 Full Flow (Recommended):

1. **Run with venv bootstrap (recommended)**

```bash
python -m chatgpt_library_archiver bootstrap [--tag-new]
```
- Creates `.venv`, installs dependencies, and runs the full flow
- Use `--tag-new` to tag newly downloaded images after syncing

All high-level commands display a unified progress bar at the bottom of the
terminal while streaming status messages (including thumbnail generation) above
it so you can monitor each stage of the workflow without losing context.

2. **Run manually inside venv**

```bash
python -m chatgpt_library_archiver [--tag-new]
```
- Downloads **only new images**, adds them to `gallery/images`, updates `gallery/metadata.json`, creates `gallery/thumbs/<file>` thumbnails, and regenerates `gallery/index.html`
- Add `--tag-new` to tag fresh images during the download

3. **Regenerate gallery or thumbnails without downloading**

 ```bash
 python -m chatgpt_library_archiver gallery [--gallery DIR] [--regenerate-thumbnails] [--force-thumbnails]
 ```
 - Rebuilds the HTML gallery from existing files (sorts metadata and copies the
  bundled `index.html`).
 - Add `--regenerate-thumbnails` to (re)create entries in `gallery/thumbs/` for every
  image; combine with `--force-thumbnails` to overwrite existing thumbnails.

4. **Generate or manage image tags**

```bash
python -m chatgpt_library_archiver tag [--gallery DIR] [--all|--ids <id...>|--remove-all|--remove-ids <id...>] [--workers N]
```
- Populates the `tags` field in `metadata.json` using the OpenAI API. By
  default, only images missing tags are processed. Override the gallery location
  with `--gallery`. Use `--all` to re-tag every image, `--ids` to tag specific
  images, `--remove-all` to clear tags from all images, or `--remove-ids` to
  clear tags for specific images. The prompt and model can be overridden with
  `--prompt` and `--model`. The command reports progress as each image is
  tagged and displays per-image and total token usage when the API includes a
  `usage.total_tokens` field. It can run in parallel with `--workers`.

5. **Import local images into your gallery**

```bash
python -m chatgpt_library_archiver import <files_or_directories...> [options]
```

- Move local files into `gallery/images` and append metadata records.
- Provide `--copy` to copy instead of move (default is move).
- Use `--recursive` when passing directories to automatically traverse and import nested images.
- Apply one or more tags to all imported items with repeated `--tag` flags.
- Supply `--conversation-link` to attach a ChatGPT conversation URL for each file listed explicitly on the command line (directory imports skip this as they may expand to many files).
- Pass `--tag-new` to immediately tag imports using the existing OpenAI tagging workflow (honors `--tag-model`, `--tag-prompt`, and `--tag-workers`).
- Enable `--ai-rename` to request a descriptive filename from OpenAI. The `tagging_config.json` file supplies the API key and optionally a `rename_prompt` value for this feature. Provide `--rename-model` or `--rename-prompt` to override the defaults ad hoc.
- Set a shared `--title` for all imported files or allow the tool to derive one from the filename/AI slug.
- Thumbnails are generated automatically in `gallery/thumbs/`. Run the command with
  `--regenerate-thumbnails [--force-thumbnails]` to refresh thumbnails for existing
  entries without importing new files.

Use the `-y/--yes` flag with any command to bypass confirmation prompts.

## 💡 Notes

- No old data is overwritten. All images are saved with unique filenames and metadata is appended.
- The gallery is fully static and self-contained.
- The `index.html` viewer is bundled with the tool and reused on each run.
- `gallery/index.html` loads `metadata.json` via JavaScript and displays all images on one page.
- Images are lazy-loaded using the Intersection Observer API so they're fetched only when they enter the viewport.
- A sticky header keeps the page title, search filters, and settings visible while you browse.
- The header and image grid span the full width of the viewport, and thumbnails are centered within their square cells.
- Use the header's search filters to filter by title or tags with fuzzy matching
  and Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) or by a date range.
- Hover over a thumbnail to reveal its title, timestamp, tags, and conversation link;
  the grid hides these details by default to keep the focus on the images. Small
  thumbnails omit the timestamp and tags to keep overlays compact.
- The gallery respects your system's light or dark preference, and the **Toggle Dark Mode** button lets you override it.
- Your selected theme, image size, and filter values are remembered for the current browser session.
- Click any thumbnail to open a full-screen viewer overlay. Navigate with the left/right
  arrow keys, press Escape to close, or follow the **Raw file** link to view the
  underlying image. Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) a thumbnail to open the raw image
  directly in a new tab without launching the viewer.

### Disk Space
This depends entirely on how many images you have.
General estimate:
- 1 image ≈ 1.8–3.3 MB
- 100 images ≈ 180–330 MB
- 1,000 images ≈ 2–3 GB
- 5,000 images ≈ 10–12 GB

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- If you get a `403` or `401`, your token or cookie may have expired. Refresh `auth.txt` by copying headers again from your browser.
- During downloads, if a `401/403` occurs, the downloader now offers to re-enter credentials interactively.
- If no new images are found, the downloader simply exits without changes.

## 🧪 Testing and Linting

Tests cover `auth.txt` parsing, gallery generation, and a full end-to-end
flow with mocked network calls so the suite runs entirely offline.
Network requests in these tests use strict URL parsing to avoid
ambiguous domain matches.

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
```

### Git hook

To ensure linting and tests pass before commits are created, configure Git to
use the provided hooks:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-commit hook runs `make lint` and `make test` and will block the commit
if either step fails.

To build a distributable package:

```
python -m build
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request. Before committing, run `pre-commit run --all-files` and `pytest` to ensure tests and linters pass.
